Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction

Introduction:
Fertilizer Recommentation system for disease Prediction is a simple ML and DL based website which recommends the best crop to grow, 
fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops.

Project Description:
Agriculture is the most important sector in todayâ€™s life. Most plants are affected by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. 
Diseases on plants placed a major constraint on the production and a major threat to food security.
Hence, early and accurate identification of plant diseases is essential to ensure high quantity and best quality. 
In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, 
changes in cultivation methods, and inadequate plant protection techniques. 
An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant.
Deep learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions that can be taken for those diseases. 

Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to identify the disease in the 
plants and suggest suitable fertilizer for the particular disease in the early stage.
In recent years, the number of diseases on plants and the degree of harm caused 
has increased due to the variation in pathogen varieties, changes in cultivation 
methods and inadequate plant protection techniques.
An automated system is introduced to identify different diseases on 
plants by checking the symptoms shown on the leaves of the plant. Deep 
learning techniques are used to identify the diseases and suggest the precautions 
that can be taken for those diseases. The main Deep Learning algorithm used 
here is CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
